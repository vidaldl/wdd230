                <b>Reasons why he visited the page: </b> As a retired farmer I like to travel to different places and find out where the residents of the place really live their lives. Finding the businesses and recommended spots by locals is not the same as following the directions of the hotel concierge. I want to be able to find what the locals do, where they eat and how they manage to enjoy their city on a budget.

                <b>Reasons why he visited the page: </b> Finding a good city with enough expecatives of economic growth is very important for me to finally find a place I want to settle my family in. Knowing who to call for questions and who can direct me in making sure I can create a business in the city is critical to accomplish my dream. I want to open a bakery in Saint Domingue and having a place where I can see what I'm really getting into and who has my back is the most important thing for me.
